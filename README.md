**MISC INFO**

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

3.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You wonâ€™t change this file directly).**

4.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the projectâ€™s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
